- `clean_customers.py`
- `clean_orders.py`

## ⚠️ Notes

- The `superstore_original.csv` is kept for reference only. All analysis uses the cleaned, separated CSVs.
- All fields such as `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Profit`, and `Discount` reflect transactional-level values.
- Discounts are stored as decimals (e.g., `0.2` for 20%).
